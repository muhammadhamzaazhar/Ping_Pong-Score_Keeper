# Ping_Pong-Score_Keeper
    Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a 
    lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small solid 
    rackets.

## Game Summary
The game is composed of two players named as `Player 1` & `Player 2`. There are buttons to keep score of both players. A drop-down menu named as `Playing To` will decide the winning point of the player, default playing point is 3, playing point ranges from **3-11**. The player which will gather the last point first will win resulting in disabling of the two buttons `Player 1` & `Player 2`. A `Reset` button will reset the playing points of both the players.
